  title: "## We Offer Flexible Hour Sessions\n\n# We know that there is no one size fits all option for our families when it comes to early childhood education and care. That is why we are giving families the freedom to choose which hours best suit their needs.\n\nNine-hour, ten-hour and full day options are available (Please refer to offering at each centre) to all families under the one associated flat fee, enabling them to make the most out of the Child Care Subsidy.\n\nFlexible Hours reduces out of pocket costs and increase access to subsidised hours, the new flexible model is part of our commitment to providing greater access to quality early childhood education and care.\n\nOur families will:\n\n* Not be limited by start and finish times like models from other early education providers.\n* Be able to confirm their enrolment in one of our flexible options.\n\nChoose from our nine-hour, ten-hour or full day sessions (please discuss individual centre offering with Centre Director) and make the most out of the Child Care Subsidy.\n\n![ ](/images/uploads/2018_10_03_17_10_27_flexible_hours_table_10_2018.docx_compatibility_mode_word.jpg)\n\n## Child Care Subsidies\n\nGreat Start Early Learning Centres is registered as a provider of \"Approved Care\" under the Child Care System (\"CCS\"). Under CCS, the Federal Government provide us with each families subsidy details directly once you have registered and applied for the Child Care Subsidy via Centrelink.\n\nIf you would like to receive the Child Care Subsidy, please include this information in your child’s enrolment form and register for Child Care Subsidy with Centrelink:\n\n* Your Customer Reference Number (CRN – issued to you by Centrelink).\n* Your child’s Customer Reference Number (issued to you by Centrelink)\n* Your date of birth (CRN Holder).\n* Your child’s date of birth.\n\n# Am I Entitled to Child Care Subsidy?\n\nThe Child Care Subsidy (CCS) is a payment made by the Australian Government to help families with the cost of quality child care and early education. This is paid directly to the service to reduce your weekly fees. It is the responsibility of the parent to register for Child Care Subsidy. This can be done by contacting Centrelink either in person, by phone on 136 150 or by accessing their My Gov account at my.gov.au\n\nThree things will determine a family’s level of Child Care Subsidy:\n\n1. A family’s combined income will determine the percentage of subsidy they are eligible to receive.\n2. An activity test will determine how many hours of subsidised care families can access, up to a maximum of 100 per fortnight (please refer below for examples of what may be included in activity hours).\n3. The type of child care service will determine the hourly rate cap.\n\nSome basic requirements must be satisfied for an individual to be eligible to\n receive the Child Care Subsidy. These include:\n\n* The age of the child (must be 13 or under and not attending secondary school).\n* The child meeting immunisation requirements.\n* The individual, or their partner, meeting the residency requirements.\n\nThe number of hours of subsidised child care that families will have access to per fortnight will be determined by a three-step activity test.\n\nIn two parent families both parents, unless exempt, must meet the activity test. In the case where both parents meet different steps of the activity test, the parent with the lowest entitlement will determine the hours of subsidised care for the child.\n\n\n\n# Important Information Regarding Absences on Your Start and End Dates\n\nIf your child is given a start date at the centre but is away for more than seven days (including weekends) before starting, NO CCS will be paid for any of those absent days. Full fees will have to be paid for these absent days. CCS will then only commence once your child has physically attended their first day at the centre.\r\n\n\r\n\nIf you have provided us with a date your child will be leaving and your child is away on their last day and more than seven days (including weekends) immediately preceding this day, NO CCS will be paid for any of those absent days. Full fees will then have to be paid for these absent days.\r\n\nhttps://www.dese.gov.au/child-care-subsidy/absences-child-care \n\n![null](/images/uploads/ccs-hours-table_07-18.png)\n\nLow income families on $66,958 (2018/19 Financial Year) or less a year who do not meet the activity test will be able to access 24 hours of subsided care per child per fortnight without having to meet the activity test, as part of the Child Care Safety Net."

enrolmentsSection3: "## Our Enrolment Terms & Fees\n\n### All fees are to be paid in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Enrolment, Fee Schedule and our Fee Policy.\n\nThe following information is general information regarding payment of centre fees.\n\n* Your child’s attendance is booked and charged on a daily basis (not a part day basis).\n* An\_initial booking fee is due when your position is confirmed to secure your child’s enrolment. The initial fee is non-refundable if your child does not attend as booked.\n* Two weeks advance payment (current week plus 2 weeks) of full fees is required before your child starts and must be maintained during your child’s attendance.\n* Fees will apply for booked days that your child does not attend due to illness, holidays or public holidays.\n* We provide Statements weekly via email and these can also be requested at any time from your Centre Director at the administration office.\n* Late Pick-up Fees: We understand that sometimes families may run late and collect their child after our early learning program ends. Please see our fee schedule for additional costs of continuing to provide care after the operating hours. This will be charged to your account accordingly. If late pick-up occurs regularly the centre reserves the right to cancel child’s enrolment.\n* If your account falls in arrears, your Centre Director will work with you to plan your payments to bring your account back to two weeks in advance. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of enrolment may result in child’s enrolment being terminated.\n* If your account is referred to our debt collectors, recovery costs of 25% of the outstanding account balance will be added to your account.\n* If an account goes into credit due to the application or backdating of CCB or CCS entitlement, that credit will remain on the customer’s account to be set against subsequent fee statements. If an account is in credit when a child leaves the Centre, after all fees owing have been paid, then the source of the balance will be reviewed to determine whether the money should be returned to the parent or refunded to the Federal Government as an overpayment of Child Care Subsidy.\n\nOur method of payment is via direct debit either from your nominated bank account or credit card. Once your completed direct debit form has been received at the centre your fees will be debited and automatically applied to your childcare account.\n\nDishonour fees are charged to you by the financial institutions. The charge is set by the financial institution or agency and is subject to change at any time. For further information consult the financial institution website.\n\nIf cash or cheque payments are made, they should be handed to the Centre Director and a cash receipt will be issued. No responsibility will be accepted by the centre for cash payments for which parents have not obtained a receipt. Cheque payments should be made payable to Great Start Early Learning Centres Pty Ltd. The Centre Director or Educator will assist you with EFTPOS payments. The details for BPay are listed on your weekly account statement."

  - content: "The number of hours of subsidised child care to which a family will be entitled will depend on how much time parents spend undertaking recognised activities, for example work, training, volunteering or study.\n\nThe Child Care Subsidy activity test takes into account both parents’ (if applicable) activities, however, the maximum hours a family will receive will be based on the person with the lowest level of activity. A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements.\r\n\nFor people with irregular work hours, such as casual employment, an estimate can be used based on the highest number of hours they expect to work in any one fortnight over a three-month period.\r\n\nUnder the new system, you will only be able to access the Child Care Subsidy if you are doing suitable activity and the amount of activity will then determine how many hours of Childcare Subsidy you are eligible for.\r\n\nActivity counts as:\r\n\n* Paid work (including unpaid lunch breaks)\r\n* Commute time from childcare centre to work (excludes time travelling form home to childcare centre and vice versa)\r\n* Authorised leave (eg maternity leave, long service leave, annual leave etc)\r\n* Unpaid leave of up to 6 months\r\n* Unpaid work in a family business\r\n* Setting up a new business\r\n* Study\r\n* Training and study (includes semester breaks)\r\n* Work experience/internships (whether paid or not)\r\n* Volunteering\r\n* Looking for work (eg internet research, contacting employers, preparing resumes/letters of application, preparing for and attending job interviews, travel time for interviews)\r\n\nPlease consult Centrelink for advice regarding your personal circumstances and subsidy entitlements."
    title: What counts as Activity Hours for Child Care Subsidies?
  - content: >-
      Like most early learning centres, your child’s place is reserved when they
      are away so the day still needs to be paid for. Each financial year, the
      Family Assistance Office will pay your childcare subsidies for the first
      42 absence days. These absences can be for any reason, including public
      holidays, and the initial 42 days must be used before any additional
      absences can be claimed (please see below).


      You may receive child care subsidies for absence days after the initial 42
      days each financial year if you are able to provide evidence to
      demonstrate the absence has occurred under permitted circumstances. There
      is no limit on these days, but you will be required to provide
      documentation to support the absence. Please see the Governments website
      for more information.
    title: Entitlement When Your Child is Absent
  - content: >-
      To secure child’s enrolment, an initial fee of two weeks fees is required
      to be paid on enrolment of your child or $100 (whichever is greater). The
      initial fee is not refundable under any circumstances; I.e. if you child
      does not attend the centre as booked, you cancel your child enrolment
      before commencement, etc. 


      Once your child commences at the centres, the amount equal to the initial
      fee will be credited to your account and offset against the attendance
      fees charged.
    title: Initial Fees to Secure Enrolment
  - content: >-
      Families taking annual leave will be entitled to a holiday discount in
      accordance with the fee schedule of the centre, provided two weeks notice
      in writing is given of intended dates of absence. Holiday discounts will
      only apply to a whole week of holidays taken at a time. Any holidays taken
      as part weeks or single days will not attract a discount. Discounts will
      only be applied to parent accounts that are up to date and where
      appropriate written notice has been given.
