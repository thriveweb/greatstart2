  - content: "Quality Area 1 of the National Quality Standard focuses on ensuring that the educational program and practice is stimulating and engaging and enhances children’s learning and development. We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing. We use a Reggio Emilia inspired approach to meet the objectives outlined in the National and Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks; including emphasis on literacy, numeracy, music and movement and social development.\_ In a Reggio Emilia learning environment, children learn meaningful skills that support them through their future education and life. Our teaching methods are linked to the National Quality Framework to ensure that a consistent and high quality early childhood education curriculum is provided.\n\nOur key policies for this area are 89 - Education, Curriculum and Learning Policy, 44 - Curriculum and Planning Policy and 82 - National Quality Framework."

      Quality Area 2 of the National Quality Standard reinforces children’s
      right to experience quality education and care in an environment that
      provides for their health and safety. We teach children about healthy
      lifestyles, including nutrition, personal hygiene (such as handwashing,
      dental hygiene and ear care), physical fitness, emotions and social
      relationships as integral to children’s wellbeing and self-confidence. We
      support the health, protection, safety and wellbeing of all children.


      #### This involves:


      * Safe Administrating of Medication to Children. Our Medication Policy
      covers the storage, authorisation, and provision of prescriptions and
      non-prescription medication.

      * Medical Conditions Management (Including allergies, anaphylaxis, asthma,
      diabetes and epilepsy). Thorough individual Medical Management Plans are
      developed and implemented for children attending in consultation with
      parents and medical practitioners. At the time of enrolment (or at
      diagnosis), families are required to advise if their child has any medical
      conditions. If the child is identified as having a medical condition or
      dietary need, a Medical Conditions Form needs to be completed and
      submitted with the enrolment form.

      * Child Safe and Protection Standards and Procedures: We acknowledge our
      responsibility to all children attending the centre and their right to
      care and protection. We take a preventative, proactive and participatory
      stance on child protection issues. To support this right the centre will
      follow the procedures articulated in the statutory legislation when
      dealing with any allegations of abuse or neglect of children. Child abuse
      can be any or a combination of the following; physical, sexual,
      psychological and neglect. Educators are responsible for preventing child
      abuse, recognising indicators and responding effectively if issues arise,
      including Mandatory Reporting of child abuse.

      * Our Child Safe Statement of Commitment: The organisation has a strong
      commitment to child safety and protection, through implementing and
      adherence to the Child Safe Standards. This commitment extends to all
      children in our service and community with an aim for children to feel
      safe, secure and supported. We acknowledge the importance of our
      organisation and community to be committed to culturally safety of
      aboriginal children, the cultural safety for culturally and/or
      linguistically diverse children and safety of children with a disability.
      Please see the Child Safety and Protection Policy for more detail on how
      we comply with the Child Safety Standard. Also see the Frequently Asked
      Questions section of our Website.

      * Food and Nutrition: Nutrition plays a pivotal role in the quality of
      care. All meals are prepared in accordance with Food Safety and Nutrition
      standards plus dietary, cultural and medical needs are catered for.

      * Incident and Injury Management. We have procedures in place to manage
      incidents and injuries. This includes recording all injuries and incident
      on the Incident, Injury, Trauma, and Illness Record form and providing a
      copy to parents. All ‘serious’ injuries are reported to the Department of
      Education and Training (DET) via the NQS ITS.

      * Unwell children: Maintaining a healthy centre community is the shared
      responsibility of parents and Educators. Our Centre is not a place for
      sick children, as we cannot provide the necessary care that ill children
      need. Any child that is unwell or suffering from an infectious illness
      must be excluded from the Centre until they are well or no longer in an
      infectious state.

      * Sun Safety and Protection: We are committed to ensuring all early
      learning professionals and children maintain a healthy ultra-violet
      exposure balance and are suitably protected when exposed to the sun. We
      are a SunSmart organisation and our policy and practices are approved by
      Sun Smart Australia.

      * No smoking environment: The Centre is a non-smoking area. This includes
      all indoor and outdoor play areas and anywhere that is within sight of the
      children (including car parks and entrances). We ask all educators,
      parents, guardians and visitors to abide by this policy.

      * Hygiene: It is our aim to minimise the spread of infection. Frequent
      hand washing and sanitizing is the single most effective method of
      preventing the spread of disease. To help us in our aim, we ask that you
      encourage your child to wash their hands-on arrival at our Centre. All
      equipment, floors and toys are regularly cleaned.  Educators follow
      cleaning schedules on daily, weekly or other periodic basis, in accordance
      with all health, safety and hygiene regulations.

      * Dental Health: We believe that it is important to establish and
      reinforce good dental health practices in children. We provide a learning
      environment that raises dental health awareness and supports the
      development of valuable life skills and habits for children and families.

      * Our Safe Sleep and Rest Practices are based on current research,
      recommendations and guidelines. 

      * Excursions: There is a detailed planning procedure for any excursions
      undertaken. We complete Excursion Risk Management Plans to ensure the
      health, safety and wellbeing of children. We also provide our families
      with this information to help them decide whether or not to allow their
      child to participate in the event.

      * Emergency action plan: We will plan for and respond effectively to fire
      and emergency evacuations. These plans are displayed on each exit.
      Evacuation procedures are practiced regularly by everyone who is present
      at the centre at time of drill.

      * Visitor to the Centre. We have strict regulations around the supervision
      of authorised visitors to our centres to ensure your children’s safety.

      * Water Safety is of great importance and the educators will undertake a
      risk assessment to ensure the safety of the children and sufficient
      supervision is maintained when engaging in water based experiences. 

      * Infectious Disease Control and Ill Children: We acknowledge each state
      and territory has legislation regarding attendance at education and care
      services and childhood immunisation – which inhibits the enrolment of
      unvaccinated children in childcare centres unless they have a medical
      exemption or are undergoing a catch-up schedule.

      * A record of the child's current immunisation status is required as part
      of the enrolment process and information about the types of records that
      are acceptable are detailed on the enrolment form. Each Centre will follow
      the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines ‘Staying
      Healthy in Child Care – Preventing Infectious diseases in child care- 5th
      Edition’. A copy of this guideline is available at the centre. Exclusion
      from the Centre will be as per legislative requirements and we follow the
      ‘Recommended minimum exclusion periods for infections conditions for
      schools, pre-schools and child care centres’ National Health and Medical
      Research Council.

      Our centres contain indoor and outdoor physical environments that support
      children’s safety and inspire creativity and independence.  We have a wide
      range of resources that allow the physical environment to be adapted to
      the children’s interests and allow them to express their individuality by
      choosing which experiences and environments they would like to play in.


      #### The physical environment is critical to:


      * contributing to children’s wellbeing, creativity and developing
      independence

      * providing a diverse range of experiences that promote children’s
      learning and development

      * keeping children safe

      * creating/organising spaces to reduce the risk of injury.


      Our key policies in this area include 14 - Safety & Maintenance Policy, 15
      - Security Policy and 90 - Environmental Sustainability Policy.
    title: NQS3 – Physical Environment
  - content: >-
      Quality Area 4 of the National Quality Standard focuses on the provision
      of qualified and experienced educators who develop warm, respectful
      relationships with children, create predictable environments and encourage
      children’s active engagement in the learning program.


      We ensure legislated staffing ratios and qualification requirements are
      met at all times. We are also committed to ensuring our team is
      appropriately motivated and experienced for its critical role in enhancing
      children’s learning and development. They achieve this by developing warm,
      respectful relationships with children, by creating safe environments for
      children, and by encouraging children’s active engagement in their
      learning programs.


      We encourage the appropriate engagement of both work experience and
      volunteer persons in our centres. Work experience students are generally
      studying towards an early childhood qualification and are placed in
      centres to acquire practical knowledge through interaction with staff and
      children.


      #### Our key policies in this area include 


      * 72 - Interaction with Children Policy

      * 79 - Staff Arrangement Policy 

      * 74 - Staff to Staff Interactions 

      * 55 - Student and Volunteer Policy

      * 11 - Supervision Policy.
    title: NQS4 – Staffing Arrangements
  - content: "Quality Area 5 of the National Quality Standard focuses on educators developing responsive, warm, trusting and respectful relationships with children that promote their wellbeing, self-esteem, sense of security and belonging. Relationships of this kind encourage children to explore the environment and engage in play and learning.\n\n#### Behaviour Guidance\n\nBehaviour guidance must always encourage the individuality and confidence of children and never diminish their self-esteem.\n\nAll Educators are aware of a variety of positive approaches to behaviour guidance and are encouraged to use them at all times. Our Educators have regular professional development training in behaviour guidance. \n\nEducators will consult with parent’s regularly on behaviour guidance policy and seek constructive solutions to any differences in values.  They will involve children in discussions about dealing with conflict and will encourage children to show empathy and healthy assertiveness.\n\nInformation on developmentally appropriate behaviours and their management will be available in the parent resource folder or please discuss with Centre Director and information will be provided.\n\n#### Indirect Guidance\n\nA well planned, developmentally appropriate program and environment will encourage more positive behaviours.\n\n#### Direct Guidance\n\nDirect guidance can be achieved by modelling appropriate behaviours, positively reinforcing appropriate behaviours, and presenting children with clear alternatives. \r\n\nThe model that we use concentrates on teaching children socially responsible behaviour. Through our model children are aware of expected behaviour and we find that children respond readily to this method of direct teaching of ‘target behaviour’. \r\n\n#### Verbal Guidance\n\nVerbal guidance will be used to immediately redirect a child’s behaviour. Language needs to be positive, clear and appropriate to the development of the child.\r\n\nExpressing approval of children without discrimination aids the development of a positive self-concept. Approval might be conveyed in many ways, such as friendly words and smiles, holding and hugging, and by encouraging a child’s efforts to achieve.\r\n\n#### Consequences\n\nEducators will develop set standards of behaviour and be consistent in keeping them. Older children will be involved in the development of these standards and made aware of the consequences of inappropriate behaviour.\r\n\nConsequences are the pivotal tool that teaches children about what behaviours are valued in a social environment. Consequences that are fairly and consistently applied help children to learn the sorts of behaviours that are needed to move and function co-operatively with others. \r\n\nOur key policies in this area are 9 - Behaviour Guidance Policy and 72 - Interaction with Children Policy."
    title: NQS 5 - Relationships with children
  - content: >-
      Quality Area 6 focuses on supportive, respectful relationships with
      families which are fundamental to achieving quality outcomes for children.
      Community partnerships that are based on active communication,
      consultation and collaboration also contribute to children’s inclusion,
      learning and wellbeing.


      Families are the primary influence in their children’s lives; they often
      have strong beliefs and values regarding the education and care of their
      children. When families and centres collaborate and build respectful
      relationships, children have the opportunity to develop a positive sense
      of self and experience respectful relationships.


      Our key policies in this area cover the following topics:


      #### Collection of Children


      Only parents/guardians and authorised nominees are permitted to collect
      your child from our early learning program, and we encourage all families
      to ensure these contact details and arrangements are kept up-to-date. Our
      key policies for this topic are 97 - QK Kiosk Rolls Management System and
      65 - Delivery and Collection Policy.


      #### Code of Conduct


      We have a Code of Conduct which outlines the core values of our centres
      and how the respectful and appropriate behaviour of all adults that work
      at and attend our centre should support these values.


      #### Enrolment and Orientation


      We aim to establish mutually respectful and supportive relationships with
      families throughout the enrolment and orientation process to promote
      positive outcomes for your child, and to ensure legislative requirements
      are met. Throughout the process, families are invited to take a tour of
      the centre and are encouraged to raise any concerns or questions about the
      operations of the centre. Our key policies for this topic:


      * 1 - Enrolment Policy

      * 45 - Transitions & Routines Policy

      * 49 - Transition to School and Other Organisations Policy 

      * 66 - Fee Policy

      * 43 - Exclusion Policy

      * 71 - Family Law and Access Policy

      * 76 - Open Door Policy

      * 6 - Parent Involvement Policy

      * 5 - Parent/Team Member Communication Policy

      * 8 - Adult Behaviour Policy


      #### Priority of Access


      The Commonwealth Government requires Childcare Providers to provide access
      to the education and care service according to the priorities of child
      policy. Each centre is only licensed to provide a specific number of hours
      of care. This means that when this number is reached, families who are
      third priority may be asked to alter their care arrangements to allow a
      family with higher priority to access the education and care service.
      Priority of enrolment is given according to available space in the Centre
      and the guidelines set down by the Australian Government.


      **First Priority:** A child at risk of serious abuse or neglect.


      **Second Priority:** A child of a single parent who satisfies, or parents
      who both satisfy the work/training/study test under section 14 of the
      Family Assistance Act 1999.


      **Third Priority: **Any other child.


      ###### **Within each category the following children are to be given
      priority:**


      * Children in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families.

      * Children in families, which include a disabled person.

      * Children in families with a non-English speaking background.

      * Children in socially isolated families.

      * Children of single parents.


      In line with the legislation all education and care services are to follow
      the guidelines when they are filling vacancies (unless they are a work
      based service in which case children of employees can be given top
      priority) and, when there are no vacancies, they may require a child who
      is third priority to leave the child care service, or alter their days, in
      order to provide a place for a higher priority child.


      #### This provision however only applies if:


      The person liable to pay child care fees for that child was notified on
      enrolment that the service followed this policy; and the service gives
      that person at least 30 days’ notice of the requirement for the child to
      leave the child care service.


      Please refer to our Priority of Access Policy for further information.


      #### Family Feedback


      We actively encourage families to provide feedback about their experiences
      with the centre at any time. It is our policy that any problems, issues or
      disputes are managed fairly and promptly, and are resolved as close as
      possible to the source of the problem.
    title: "NQS 6.\_Collaborative partnerships with families and communities"

      We are committed to strong governance that supports effective management
      and operations of the centre which is consistent with our statement of
      philosophy.

      leadership, and a plan for continually improving and reviewing the
      operation and management of the centre.  Our leadership team have a

      the administration, policies and procedures, and curriculum of the
      centre.  We continuously review best practice in education to ensure our

      environment for all children. We document our plans for continuous
      improvement in our Quality Improvement Plan (QIP). Please ask the Centre
      Director for a copy of the QIP if you wish to read.

  - content: "All parents are encouraged to discuss any grievances in an environment that is open and responsive. Any grievances will be handled confidentially (unless there are legislative requirements not to). Parents and their children will not be disadvantaged in any way for raising a grievance.\n\nWe encourage informal resolution as a first option. We want to model effective conflict resolution techniques and want to respond to parents concerns without any disruption to the child or the relationships between educators and families.\n\nThe [Complaints and Grievance Policy](/images/uploads/7-–-complaints-grievance-policy_06-2020.pdf) is also available in the Policy Handbook in the foyer of the Centre. If the issue cannot be resolved through informal resolution, we will follow the procedure outlined in the above policy.\n\n#### Centres Management and Approved Provider\n\n**Scott Zannes**\n\nManaging Director\n\nGreat Start Early Learning Centres\n\nPO Box 3740, Victoria Point West QLD 4165\n\nPhone: 04 1140 1288 \n\nEmail: szannes@mychildelc.com.au \n\n- - -\n\n**Should any parent or guardian wish to discuss concerns with the state regulatory office, please contact:**\n\n**\LFor East Malvern Early Learning Centre**\n\nDepartment of Education and Training (DET) - Southern Metropolitan Area\n\nQuality Assessment and Regulation Division\n\nTelephone: 03 8904 2500\n\nEmail: smr.qar@edumail.vic.gov.au  \n\nPostal Address: PO Box 5, DANDENONG VIC 3175\n\nLevel 5, 165-169 Thomas Street, DANDENONG VIC 3175\n\n- - -\n\n**For Mildura Centres**\n\nDepartment of Education and Training (DET) - North-Western Victoria Region\n\nQuality Assessment and Regulation Division\n\nTelephone: 03 4433 7502\n\nEmail: lmr.qar@edumail.vic.gov.au \n\nPostal Address: PO Box 442, BENDIGO VIC\_3550\n\nStreet Address: 7-15 McLaren Street, BENDIGO VIC 3550"

### The National Quality Framework, Policies and Procedures

The National Quality Framework (NQF) encourages services to provide a high quality and consistent standard of early childhood education and care across Australia. The NQF includes:

* A national legislative framework that consists of the Education and Care Services National Law and Education and Care Services National Regulations
* A National Quality Standard (NQS)
* An assessment and ratings system
* A regulatory authority in each state and territory which has responsibility for the approval, monitoring and quality assessment of services
* A national body responsible for providing oversight of the new system and ensuring consistency of approach – the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA).

##### **Centres are assessed and rated against seven quality areas, of the NQS. The standards cover children’s development and education as well as relationships with families, educator qualifications, and the service environment.**

The seven National Quality Standard (NQS) areas are:  NQS1. Educational program and practice. NQS 2. Children’s health and safety. NQS 3. The physical environment. NQS 4. Staffing arrangements. NQS 5. Relationships with children. NQS 6. Collaborative partnerships with families and communities. NQS 7. Leadership and service management.

Our policies and procedures cover these key seven areas. You can find more information about the NQF and NQS at [acecqa.gov.au](https://acecqa.gov.au).

All centres are required to have policies and related documents in relation to certain matters under Regulation 168 of the Education and Care Services National Regulations. If you would like a copy of any centre policy please speak with your Centre Director or view at the centre.
