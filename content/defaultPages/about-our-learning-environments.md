We understand that as parents you strive to create a caring and safe environment for your family, and it is only natural you seek the same standard for an early learning centre. Your child’s transition from home to one of our early learning centres should be seamless and it will feel like a home away from home where they are comfortable, happy and inspired.

We view the environment as the third Teacher. Children are encouraged to flow freely between the indoor and outdoor learning environments which include vegetable patches, relaxation spaces, areas to grow and care for living things, areas for musical play, areas for large scale construction activities and carefully considered learning spaces. Mirrors are used to enable children to see things from different angles, encourage play, view the world in different ways and to develop a sense of self. Spaces are adapted to each age group including Nursery, Toddlers, Prekindergarten and Kindergarten.

Careful consideration has also been given to the family of each child and parents are encouraged to participate in our curriculum and educational programs. We provide parents with the opportunity to engage and enjoy the environment, just as much as the children. Each and every day, families are invited to provide input in our curriculum and we also have a calendar of events to allow family members to be a part of their child’s learning.

Our early learning centres are places where environmental education is part of the everyday philosophy and curriculum. We believe in teaching the children a sense of responsibility to both the living and non-living environment, providing sustainability classes for children.

We support working families, opening up to 12 hours per day, Monday to Friday, 52 weeks a year, to offer the convenience and flexibility that busy families need. Families are able to choose hours during our opening hours that best suit their family schedule. From six weeks of age until they are ready to attend school, your child will receive high quality education and care that is important to their development and to give them a great start.

To see our beautiful, engaging learning environments for yourself, contact us to arrange a centre tour. We would love to show you our classrooms and outdoor play spaces.
