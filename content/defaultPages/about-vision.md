      We view children as active learners who are involved in their own
      acquisition of knowledge. Each child arrives at our service with their own
      experiences, knowledge, personality, interests and needs. Children learn
      through play, exploration, problem solving and sharing of knowledge
      through social play.

      We have an uncompromising commitment to nurturing active bodies and
      creating healthy minds through a holistic approach to early childhood
      development. We strive to deliver this by creating an environment that
      empowers, challenges and provides opportunities for children to develop to
      their full potential.

      It is the Educator’s role to facilitate and support the child’s learning.
      Small group interactions are encouraged and children are provided with
      opportunities to collaborate and create inquiry projects.  Independence
      and problem-solving skills are encouraged to help children resolve social
      conflicts and build relationships.  Children are regularly engaged in
      discussions that encourage them to reflect on their own social
      interactions and develop their social skills.


      ##### We aim to promote relationships that support children to:


      * feel a sense of belonging through promoting a strong sense of identity
      which allows them to feel safe, secure and supported;

      * see themselves as constructive contributors to the community;

      * see themselves as valued and unique;

      * engage in caring and respectful relationships;

      * develop resilience, knowledge and confident self-identities;

      * be active participants in their learning and in creating their
      environment;

      * be competent/confident learners;

      * be respected and recognized for their strengths, interests and
      abilities;

      * provide input over the direction of their learning;

      * have endless opportunities to express and embrace their individuality;
      and

      * be encouraged to play and this is valued as children’s work.
    title: Relationships

      In the Reggio approach, the Teacher is considered a co-learner and
      collaborator with the child and not just an instructor. Educators are
      encouraged to facilitate the child's learning by planning activities and
      lessons based on the child's interests, asking questions to further
      understanding and actively engaging in the activities alongside the child.


      We recognise the importance of open and honest communication, team work
      and collaboration between families and Educators and strive to form
      positive relationships with all. We acknowledge that learning is life-long
      and are committed to professional development. In our interaction with
      children our Educators will:


      * have a passion for children’s learning;

      * focus on maintaining the health and safety of the children and the
      environment;

      * demonstrate personal excellence and team work in their role as Teachers,
      nurturers and professional contributors to the child’s environment; always
      offering opportunity for exploration, fascination, examination and
      provocation;

      * have positive interactions and relationships with children and families;

      * facilitate an emergent curriculum based on The Reggio Emilia approach.
      This approach to teaching young children puts the natural development of
      children as well as the close relationship they share with their
      environment as the centre of the philosophy; and

      * act with integrity and honesty and offer flexibility to each child,
      their family and their peers.


      Educators and the service formally acknowledge and commit to the Early
      Childhood Australia Code of Ethics (2016) and will uphold the outlined
      ethical principles and professional standards to guide decision making and
      practice.
    title: Role of Teachers and Educators
  - content: >-
      We view the environment as the third Teacher.  It should be creative,
      supportive and inclusive so that children feel comfortable and safe.  Our
      environment is designed to provide children with opportunities to work
      together in small groups or independently, and reflects the local
      community and the families who use our service.  The children are
      encouraged to move freely through the classroom to explore the areas that
      interest them.  We feel technology and computers are an essential learning
      tool for today’s child, and it is incorporated into the child’s learning
      environment.
    title: Environment
  - content: >-
      We work to support families in their parenting role and share with them
      information of benefit to their child’s development. We encourage families
      to be actively involved in the life of the service. Through sharing
      cultures, ideas, knowledge, strengths and differences, we develop
      partnerships with families that are beneficial to the child’s learning and
      development. We incorporate a model of family grouping which allows
      siblings to be together.


      Working in partnership with parents and families we will:


      * create relationships of respect, trust, communication, consultation and
      information sharing;

      * understand the importance of a child’s home and family/community;

      * recognise parents as their child’s first and most influential teachers;
      and

      * recognise the skills and interests of families and incorporate their
      beliefs and values into our centre.


      We feel it is important to connect to our local community and its
      resources to create avenues for learning opportunities, and encourage
      children to connect and contribute to their world.
    title: Families and the Community
  - content: >-
      The children’s experiences are documented to make their learning visible
      to all. This is achieved through a portfolio presentation approach.  We
      document using photos, comments, art work and learning stories.  Recording
      of this information leads to informed decision making about the provision
      of materials and future experiences for the children.  


      Child’s achievement are evaluated against the Early Years Learning
      outcomes.  We provide Child Reflection Reports and Transition Statements
      that document each child’s learning and development.


      We create a curriculum that empowers children to make choices, promote
      peer relationships and to provoke thoughts and imagination.  Through
      observing and listening to the children we question and suggest new
      possibilities and encourage them to search and explore meaning in whatever
      they do.


      ##### Our curriculum supports:


      * having a play based emergent curriculum;

      * numeracy, literacy, music and movement, science and social development;

      * children developing knowledge and an understanding of technology and
      computers;

      * promoting physical activity, health and wellbeing;

      * adopting intentional and spontaneous teaching methods to optimise
      learning;

      * child lead and initiated experiences;

      * structured but flexible routines;

      * family participation and input to allow the Educators to pursue the
      child’s interests;

      * scaffolding experiences and projects to extend children’s learning;

      * developing school readiness;

      * reflecting and evaluating our practices; and

      * keeping up to date with leading research on early childhood education
      and innovation.


      We periodically evaluate and reflect on our practices to continuously
      improve in all areas of the service.

    Great Start Early Learning Centres are committed to educational excellence
    for every child through the delivery of high-quality early years curriculum.

#### Our Vision

We strive for all children to achieve their full potential by offering the education, care and nurturing they need to grow and have a great start in life.

#### Our Philosophy

We are committed to educational excellence for every child through the delivery of high quality early years curriculum.  Our pedagogy promotes school readiness and achievement of learning outcomes by applying our knowledge and experience of how children learn and play.

 We understand at Great Start Early Learning Centres the importance of education and believe that childhood is a unique time of life which should be valued and enjoyed. We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing. We use a Reggio Emilia inspired approach to meet the objectives outlined in the National and Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks; including emphasis on literacy, numeracy, music and movement and social development.  In a Reggio Emilia learning environment, children learn meaningful skills that support them through their future education and life. Our teaching methods are linked to the National Quality Standards for Early Childhood Education and Care & School Age Care to ensure that a consistent and high quality early childhood education curriculum is provided.

We believe that children are capable, inquisitive and active learners who play a crucial role in education.  It is our role as Educators to support and scaffold the children’s development and learning.  We believe in allowing children to learn through exploration, inquiry projects and open-ended play.  We value an inclusive, supportive and stimulating learning environment that evokes imagination and creativity, while providing opportunities for problem solving and independence.  Collaboration between children, educators and families is valued and enables us to better understand the child as a whole.  We believe in documenting the children’s experiences to make their learning visible to our community and provide the children with opportunities to reflect, share and build on their understanding.
