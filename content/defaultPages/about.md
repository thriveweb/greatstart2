## Welcome to Great Start Early Learning Centres

##### **We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing.**

For this reason, Great Start Early Learning Centres employs professional educators that focus on building our children’s social, emotional and physical wellbeing, while teaching them to be respectful to others and the community in which they live. Supporting and strengthening all of these aspects of the child gives them the best foundation for their future.

We have taken the Reggio Emilia Approach to early childhood education and adapted it to suit the Australian culture, climate and educational expectations of families. Our curriculum is fun and exciting within a safe and secure environment and links to the Victorian Early Years Learning Framework and the National Early Years Framework. The regulating body ACECQA, has assessed our centres and we are very proud of the quality of our education and care.

We understand that as parents you strive to create a caring and safe environment for your family, and it is only natural you seek the same standard for an early learning centre. Your child’s transition from home to one of our early learning centres should be seamless and it will feel like a home away from home where they are comfortable, happy and inspired.

We support working families by being open 11 to 12 hours per day, Monday to Friday, 52 weeks a year, to offer the convenience and flexibility that busy families need. From six weeks of age until they are ready to attend school, your child will receive the highest quality education and care.

All our educators and teachers are qualified in early childhood education and have considerable early learning experience. Our kindergarten and preschool teachers have university qualifications.
Our Educators have access to the best resources, expertise and professional development to allow them to deliver the highest quality education and care to your children.

We look forward to welcoming you and your family.

## Acknowledgement of Country

We are proud to acknowledge the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the traditional custodians of this land, in which we live, love and play. We pay my respects to the Elders past, present and emerging, for they hold the memories, the traditions, the culture and hopes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across the nation.

## Child Safe Standards - Our Statement of Commitment

Our organisation has a strong commitment to child safety, wellbeing and protection, through implementing and adherence to the Child Safe Standards and the Information Sharing Scheme. This commitment extends to all children in our service and community with an aim for children to feel safe, secure and supported. The welfare of the children in our care will always be our first priority and we have a zero-tolerance approach to child abuse and harm.  We acknowledge the importance of our organisation and community to be committed to culturally safety of aboriginal children, the cultural safety for culturally and/or linguistically diverse children and safety of children with a disability.
