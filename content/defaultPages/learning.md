### We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing.

We recognise that early childhood is a time when foundations are laid for future health, learning and wellbeing. We use a Reggio Emilia inspired approach to meet the objectives outlined in the National and Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Frameworks; including social skills, language, maths, investigation, creative pursuits, fine and gross motor skills, sensory experiences, cultural experiences and environmental understanding.

Each day has structure and a flexible routine and includes time for play, project work and also free choice. Every child has learning goals, and each child’s progress is monitored by observation-based assessment and documentation. In addition, an online learning portfolio is compiled for every child to capture their unique creativity and expression whilst regular communication with parents is maintained via our My Family Lounge App. A Daily Journal is available at the end of each day which documents the experiences and learning throughout the day. Our educators are always willing to discuss your child’s learning and day with you. You will be amazed what your child will learn and the experiences your child is involved in at our early learning centres.

The primary means of learning in early childhood is through play. Play is purposeful and goal-centred. The curriculum is designed to cater for each child’s needs and interests. Play is a vital part of a child’s life and is the way they make sense of their world. It is the basic ingredient to learning, develops new skills, and stimulates intellectual growth.
