### Our curriculum supports the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) and the Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF).

EYLF and VEYLDF describes the principles, practices, and outcomes essential to support and enhance young childrenâ€™s learning from birth to five years of age, as well as their transition to school.

The framework has a strong emphasis on play-based learning, and recognises the importance of communication and language (including early literacy and numeracy) and social and emotional development. Through implementing the early years learning framework in our educational programs, we help your child to develop:

* A strong sense of identity.
* Connections with their world.
* A strong sense of wellbeing.
* Confidence and involvement in their learning.
* Effective communication skills.
