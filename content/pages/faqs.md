      - content: "The Approved Provider, Nominated Supervisor, employees and volunteers will implement a Child Protection Risk Management Strategy to ensure the health, wellbeing and safety of all children at the service, protect children from harm and protect the integrity of employees and volunteers.\n\nOur Child Safe and Protection Policy advises of our commitment, our policies and procedures in relation to the the seven Standards are as follows:\n\n* Strategies to embed a culture of child safety through effective leadership arrangements.\n* A child safe policy or statement of commitment to child safety.\n* A code of conduct that establishes clear expectations for appropriate behaviour with children\n* Screening, supervision, training, and other human resources practices that reduce the risk of child abuse by new and existing staff\n* Processes for responding to and reporting suspected child abuse.\n* Strategies to identify and reduce or remove risks of child abuse.\n* Strategies to promote the participation and empowerment of children.\n\n_**Statement of Commitment to Child Safety and Protection**_\n\nThe organisation has a strong commitment to child safety and protection, through implementing and adherence to the Child Safe Standards. This commitment extends to all children in our service and community with an aim for children to feel safe, secure and supported. We acknowledge the importance of our organisation and community to be committed to culturally safety of aboriginal children, the cultural safety for culturally and/or linguistically diverse children and safety of children with a disability. \n\n_**The centres’ approach to child safety and protection is based on the following principles:**_\n\n•\tChildren have the right to feel safe, secure and under the protection of responsible, caring, trustworthy, adults at all times.\n\n•\tChildren will be respected and in no way degraded, endangered, exploited, intimidated or harmed psychologically or physically.\n\n•\tWarm words and loving touch are basic needs throughout life. The loss of spontaneous affection would be detrimental to both children and staff.\n\n•\tPhysical contact is part of the nurturing of children and helps create and sustain trusting relationships and add to feelings of security.\n\n_**Who in our service upholds the Child Safe Standards? **_\n\nChild Safety Officer role is held by the Nominated Supervisor as part of their role to promote and maintain safety and health of children. In the temporary absences of the Nominated Supervisor the Responsible Person – Person in Charge of Service will hold this role. The Child Safety Officer role is also supported by the Wellbeing and Social Justice and Equity Representative/committees of the service. \n\n_**Understanding Your Obligations - Everyone has a part to play to protect children**_\n\nAs community members, we all have a moral obligation to protect any child under our care and supervision from foreseeable harm.  As early childhood service staff members, you play an especially critical role in protecting children (including identifying, responding to and reporting child abuse) and must meet a range of legal obligations to do so.\n\nThese legal obligations vary, depending on the nature of the service and your role within it. However the best way to comply and the best way to protect children in your care is to follow the: Four Critical Actions for Early Childhood Services.\n\nThere are certain classes of professionals, who are classified as **\"mandatory reporters**\". Within an early childhood service setting, mandatory reporters include:\n\n•\ta person registered to teach or with permission to teach under the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (including early childhood and primary teachers and early childhood workers) \n\n•\tregistered doctors and nurses (including Maternal Child Health Nurses).\n\n_**Child Safe Code of Conduct**_\n\nThe service upholds the Child Safe Code of Conduct for employers, educators, volunteers, students, families, service community members and children to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children.\n\nThe Child Safe Standards, provide guidance and we follow the Child Safe Code of Conduct to clearly expectations for appropriate behaviour with children and adults. Further the service community (staff, volunteers, children and families) acknowledge the importance of an inclusive and supportive approach and understanding of safe behaviours and relationships with Aboriginal children, culture and/or linguistically diverse children and children with disabilities.\n\n**Our Child Safe Code of Conduct:**\n\nAll paid and unpaid staff (including volunteers, students on placement, trainees) and parents, family members and members of the service community are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of children and young people who engage with the service. All people of the service community are expected to act in accordance with this Child Safe Code of Conduct in their physical and online interactions with children and young people under the age of 18 years.\n\n_**WILL:**_\t\n\n• Act in accordance with the organisation’s Child Safety and Protection Policies and procedures at all times. \n\n• Behave respectfully, courteously and ethically towards children and their families and towards other staff. \n\n• Listen and respond to the views and concerns of children, particularly if they communicate (verbally or non-verbally) that they do not feel safe or well. \n\n• Promote the human rights, safety and wellbeing of all children in the organisation. \n\n• Demonstrate appropriate personal and professional boundaries. \n\n• Consider and respect the diverse backgrounds and needs of children. \n\n• Create an environment that promotes and enables children’s participation and is welcoming, culturally safe and inclusive for all children and their families. \n\n• Involve children in making decisions about activities, policies and processes that concern them wherever possible. \n\n• Contribute, where appropriate, to the organisation’s policies, discussions, learning and reviews about child safety and wellbeing. \n\n• Identify and mitigate risks to children’s safety and wellbeing as required by the organisation’s risk assessment and management policy or process. \n\n• Respond to any concerns or complaints of child harm or abuse promptly and in line with the organisation’s policy and procedure for receiving and responding to complaints. \n\n• Report all suspected or disclosed child harm or abuse as required by the legislation and by policy and procedure on internal and external reporting. \n\n• Comply with the organisation’s protocols on communicating with children. \n\n• Comply with regulation and the organisation’s policies and procedures on record keeping and information sharing.\n\n**_WILL NOT:_**\n\n• Engage in any unlawful activity with or in relation to a child. \n\n• Engage in any activity that is likely to physically, sexually or emotionally harm a child. \n\n• Unlawfully discriminate against any child or their family members. \n\n• Be alone with a child unnecessarily. \n\n• Arrange personal contact, including online contact, with children for a purpose unrelated to the organisation’s activities. \n\n• Disclose personal or sensitive information about a child, including images of a child, unless the child and their parent or legal guardian consent or unless required to do so by the organisation’s policy and procedure on reporting. \n\n• Use inappropriate language in the presence of children, or show or provide children with access to inappropriate images or material. \n\n• Work with children while under the influence of alcohol or prohibited drugs. \n\n• Ignore or disregard any suspected or disclosed child harm or abuse.\n\n_**If you believe the Child Safe Code of Conduct has been breached by another person in the organisation, you will:\t**_\n\n• Act to prioritise the best interests of children. \n\n• Take actions promptly to ensure that children are safe. \n\n• Promptly report any concerns per the policy and procedure.\n\n• Follow the organisation’s policies and procedures for receiving and responding to complaints and concerns. \n\n• Comply with legislative requirements on reporting, and with the organisation’s policy and procedure on internal and external reporting.\n\n**_How do we empower children and promote their understanding and awareness of Child Safety?

          Every child develops at a different pace, and when you and your Centre
          Director feel your child is ready, your child will move to a new
          classroom and new experiences. The move between classrooms is called
          transitioning. Some children need time to transition and this is
          completely normal. During the transition time, your child will visit
          the new room and start to become familiar with other educators and
          their new environments.
