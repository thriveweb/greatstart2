      title: 'Flexible Hours: Maximise Your Child Care Subsidy'
      subtitle: >-
        Nine-hour, ten-hour and full day options are available to all families
        under the one associated flat fee, enabling them to make the most out of
        the Child Care Subsidy. We know that there is no one size fits all
        option for our families when it comes to early childhood education and
        care. That is why we are giving families the freedom to choose which
        hours best suit their needs.
