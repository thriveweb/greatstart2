### The National Quality Framework (NQF) encourages services to provide a high quality and consistent standard of early childhood education and care across Australia. The NQF includes:

* A national legislative framework that consists of the Education and Care Services National Law and Education and Care Services National Regulations.
* A National Quality Standard (NQS).
* Assessment and Rating System
* A regulatory authority in each state and territory which has responsibility for the approval, monitoring and quality assessment of services.
* A national body responsible for providing oversight of the new system and ensuring consistency of approach - the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA).

Centres are assessed and rated against seven quality areas of the NQS. The standards cover children development and education as well as relationships with families, educator qualifications, and the service environment.

###### **We are pleased that all our centres are recognised by ACECQA as ‘Exceeding’ National Quality Standards. These are the National Quality Standard areas:**

* NQS 1 - Educational program and practice.
* NQS 2 - Children’s health and safety.
* NQS 3 - The physical environment.
* NQS 4 - Staffing arrangements.
* NQS 5 - Relationships with children.
* NQS 6 - Collaborative partnerships with families and communities.
* NQS 7 - Leadership and service management.

We are constantly seeking ways to improve our programs to ensure we deliver a quality of education that exceeds the standards and sets a benchmark for the industry.
