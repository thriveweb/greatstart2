      I am very passionate about the Reggio Emilia Approach. We tailor our
      curriculum to nurture a child’s intellectual growth and creativity, and
      lay down strong foundations which are so vital in the early years. Our
      curriculum is designed to build upon the children’s interests and to
      develop their skills. Our programming format is unique and is designed to
      address key learning areas including social skills, language, numeracy,
      investigation, creative pursuits, fine and gross motor skills, sensory
      experiences, cultural experiences and environmental understanding. In
      addition to this it addresses the Outcomes as outlined in the Early Years
      Learning Frameworks.


      I believe that each child is unique and learns and explores in his or her
      own way. Therefore, we encourage building on their own interests and
      strengths through scaffolding, mentoring and facilitating their learning
      and development. I believe that our centre truly captivates this and we
      ignite the endless possibilities of learning by embracing challenges and
      rejoicing in accomplishments through our various spaces, open-ended
      resources and our vibrant atmosphere.


      The team I am fortunate to work with shares my passion for seeing children
      meet their potential. They are dedicated, professional, experienced and
      highly qualified.


      We invite you to come and visit our centre to meet our team and to see for
      yourself our commitment to your child’s early learning journey.

      I hold an Advanced Diploma of Early Childhood and I have been in the early
      childhood profession since 2005. I am extremely passionate about early
      childhood education; working as a Qualified Educator, Educational Leader
      and Centre Director.


      Having worked with all age groups and having been involved in all aspects
      of child development, I believe that childhood is a special time of life
      and that the first five years are so very important not only for the child
      but also for the family. It is a privilege to be a part of a child’s
      fundamental growth and development and I’m sure that you would agree that
      there is something very rewarding in seeing children reach their true
      potential during this formative and important period of time.


      I look forward to meeting and working with you and your family within our
      centre community.

      I have been working in early childhood for 6 years here at Mildura Central
      Early Learning Centre and hold a Diploma of Early Childhood. My strong
      passion and excitement for the early years is supported through the
      Victorian Early Years Learning Framework and many professional development
      opportunities. I have explored learning and development with all age
      groups as Educational Leader with inspiration from Reggio Emilia and our
      local community.


      I look forward to meeting and working with you and your family.

      Hello, my name is Bree Harding and I am the Assistant Centre Director at
      Mildura Central Early Learning Centre.

      During this time I have had the opportunity to work with children of all
      ages from 0-5 years, in each of the rooms at the centre. I continue to
      learn and be inspired in my role, and have had, and continue to work with
      many great educators that bring with them a lot of experience in working
      with children.


      My personal philosophy is; I believe that each child is a unique
      individual and that all children develop through their own pattern of
      growth and development. Supporting children’s self-confidence and
      self-esteem is important in helping them reach their developmental
      milestones.


      I believe in the Reggio Emilia Approach, providing a quality curriculum
      and environment where children are encouraged to learn, create, imagine,
      discover, problem solve and play.


      Inclusion and cultural understanding is an important part of the
      curriculum. As a result, family involvement is important and encouraged
      and families are well informed and welcomed to participate in all
      activities at our centre. Ongoing communication with families is necessary
      to continue to meet the needs of children in our care. 


      I look forward to meeting you and your children.
