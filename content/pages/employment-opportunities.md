We strive to maintain a high-quality recruitment process for all our prospective educators. We aim to adopt a fair and ethical approach to the recruitment of all staff. We welcome applications from any individuals that possess the required qualifications and have a passion for early childhood education.

We are continually assessing our recruitment practices to ensure that the right people are employed in the right roles. We will continue to review, update and modify these practices, where necessary, to ensure the highest quality of candidates are sought.

Please note only shortlisted candidates will be contacted.

Requirements include:

•	The organisation seeks to have a culturally diverse workplace; embracing different culture and backgrounds. This includes promoting applicants from Aboriginal and /or people from culturally and/or linguistically diverse backgrounds.

•	processes (including job advertisements) which ensure employees and volunteers have clear Working With Children Checks or they are exempt (see http://www.workingwithchildren.vic.gov.au/)

•	interview questions and referee checks which reference person’s approach to child safety and protection

•	documented induction/ orientation checklists which reference child safety and protection, supervision, compliance with National Law and Regulations, NQS, Code of Conduct, policies and procedures

•	annual training and development to ensure individuals are clear about their roles and responsibilities to protect children from harm, are aware of their reporting obligations, can confidently recognise the indicators of harm (see Appendix) and understand documenting and reporting procedures. 

•	annual performance appraisals for employees
