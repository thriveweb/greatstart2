  parents. QK Journeys is accessed via the My Family Lounge account which is
  created upon enrolment of your child.


  QK Journeys allows educators to plan, set goals, prepare learning
  documentation and create your child’s learning portfolio. The My Family Lounge
  App and website allows parents to feel more involved in their child’s day by
