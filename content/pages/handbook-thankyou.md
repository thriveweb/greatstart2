  **Thanks for downloading our family handbook. The best way to get a feel for
  the centre is to book a centre tour.**


  We would love to find your child a place at our centre. Please contact the
  Centre Director to arrange a centre tour if you have not already had one. A
  centre tour is a great way for you and your child to meet the educators,
  understand our curriculum and learning programs and see our environment first
  hand.
