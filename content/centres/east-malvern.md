      #### Outdoor Play Spaces


      Our outdoor play space stimulates children's imagination, creativity,
      exploration, discovery, engagement and a sense of wonder. We have created
      sensory gardens, mud kitchens, herb and vegetable gardens, natural
      materials and magical play spaces. We have carefully designed and planned
      spaces to encourage a stronger understanding of the environment and
      sustainability – while giving children the scope to explore, play and let
      their imaginations roam.


      #### Our Educators


      We believe that we are only as great as our people. Our team of educators
      are well trained, knowledgeable, trust worthy and above all else, their
      level of commitment to the wellbeing of children is second to none. All

      advance diplomas, diplomas and certificate III in early childhood. All our
      educators hold Working With Children Checks and have current first aid and

    testimonial: >-
      Since our daughter began at East Malvern Early Learning Centre her
      confidence has grown significantly and she is thriving across all areas of
      her development. This is thanks in great deal to the dedicated, caring
      educators and the rich, holistic programs available at the centre.  Our
      daughter is so engaged in all learning opportunities presented to the
      children and we love seeing her make connections with what she has learnt
      both at home and at the centre. We love the sense of community that has
      been built through regular parent and family involvement, as well as
      valuing the children’s interests and including them in their learning. We
      honestly couldn’t have found a better centre to trust with the care and
      wellbeing of our daughter.

    **Liz Cosier – Centre Director**


    I am very passionate about the Reggio Emilia Approach. We tailor our
    curriculum to nurture a child’s intellectual growth and creativity, and lay
    down strong foundations which are so vital in the early years. Our
    curriculum is designed to build upon the children’s interests and to develop
    their skills. Our programming format is unique and is designed to address
    key learning areas including social skills, language, numeracy,
    investigation, creative pursuits, fine and gross motor skills, sensory
    experiences, cultural experiences and environmental understanding. In
    addition to this it addresses the Outcomes as outlined in the Early Years
    Learning Frameworks.


    I believe that each child is unique and learns and explores in his or her
    own way. Therefore, we encourage building on their own interests and
    strengths through scaffolding, mentoring and facilitating their learning and
    development. I believe that our centre truly captivates this and we ignite
    the endless possibilities of learning by embracing challenges and rejoicing
    in accomplishments through our various spaces, open-ended resources and our
    vibrant atmosphere. 


    The team I am fortunate to work with shares my passion for seeing children
    meet their potential. They are dedicated, professional, experienced and
    highly qualified. We invite you to come and visit our centre to meet our
    team and to see for yourself our commitment to your child’s early learning
    journey.
