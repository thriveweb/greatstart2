      #### Positive Learning Environment


      At Mildura Early Learning Centre, we provide an environment where both
      children and families feel safe, secure and supported. A place where
      partnerships and friendships can be formed and maintained, where trust and
      credibility can be built upon and upheld, and lines of communication are
      always open and valued.

      #### Outdoor Play Spaces


      Our inspired outdoor play spaces stimulate children's imagination,
      creativity, exploration, discovery, engagement and a sense of wonder. We
      have created sensory gardens, mud kitchens, herb and vegetable gardens,
      natural materials, a river creek bed, loose parts play and magical play
      spaces. We have carefully designed and planned spaces to encourage a
      stronger understanding of the environment and sustainability – while
      giving children the scope to explore, play and let their imaginations
      roam.

      #### Our Community & Enrichment Programs


      A major focus for our centre is how working with the broader community can
      help us enrich the children’s learning experience. Through visits to the
      centre as well as excursions and participation in community events, we are
      able to deepen the relationship between the centre and the community,
      while teaching the children about being a contributing and active member
      of society.


      We invite you to come and take a look at our fabulous early learning
      centre and see our high quality centre first hand.

testimonials:
  - name: 'Kristen, Alaska’s Mum'
    testimonial: >-
      Alaska has been attending Mildura Early Learning Centre for 2 months, when
      she started we were apprehensive as we had a bad experience at another
      centre. Alaska was only 6 months when she started and we wondered how she
      would go being at care, three times a week. We attended the orientation
      days and absolutely fell in love with the Koala room and the centre
      itself. The staff are professional, caring and made us feel so welcome.
      Alaska loves going to care and has adjusted incredibly well, so much that
      she gets excited and starts smiling when we arrive, she is also always
      having a great time with the staff and other children when we arrive.
      Sometimes I think she would quite like to stay longer! The staff genuinely
      care and have made the whole experience stress free for us, we know that
      Alaska is being cared for by her second family.

    testimonial: >-
      We have had 3 out of our 4 children come through Mildura Early Learning
      Centre, from babies right through the kindergarten program and off to
      school. We cannot recommend the service any more highly. The level of
      education and care provided to our children was important and as working
      parents there is always an element of guilt in leaving your children in
      care. However the service provided to families at the centre soon removes
      that guilt. The centre is family friendly, large and functional rooms with
      lots of activities and options for play as well as regularly organised
      incursions and excursions for the children to attend. The educational toys
      are rotated and updated regularly. We have also appreciated the
      willingness of the centre to be accommodating for extra sessions where
      required and available.

    **Megan Gooding – Centre Director**


    I am very passionate about the Reggio Emilia Approach. We tailor our
    curriculum to encourage learning and lay down strong foundations which are
    so vital in the early years. Our curriculum is designed to address the
    children’s interests and to develop their skills. Our programming format is
    unique and is designed to address key learning areas including social
    skills, language, maths, investigation, creative pursuits, fine and gross
    motor skills, sensory experiences, cultural experiences and environmental
    understanding. In addition to this it addresses the Outcomes as outlined in
    the Early Years Learning Frameworks.


    I believe that each child is unique and learns and explores in his or her
    own way. Therefore, we encourage building on their own interests and
    strengths through scaffolding, mentoring and facilitating their learning and
    development. I believe that our centre truly captivates this and we ignite
    the endless possibilities of learning by embracing challenges and rejoicing
    in accomplishments through our various spaces, open-ended resources and our
    vibrant atmosphere. 


    The team I am fortunate to work with shares my passion for seeing children
    meet their potential. They are dedicated, professional, experienced and
    highly qualified. We invite you to come and visit our centre to meet our
    team and to see for yourself our commitment to your child’s early learning
    journey.
