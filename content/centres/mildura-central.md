      Mildura Central Early Learning Centre is a caring and nurturing
      environment which my child thoroughly enjoys attending. The educational
      program offered is one which is well planned and extends my child's
      interest and knowledge. He particularly enjoys Jolly Phonics, and has the
      whole family singing along.


      The educators are wonderful with their caring and warm nature, showing a
      genuine interest in my child and his growth and development, keeping me up
      to date about his learning through the My family lounge app.


      I couldn't recommend Mildura Central Early Learning Centre more, we are so
      happy with our son's education and care!

    testimonial: >-
      Mildura Central attracted me because of the location of the Centre, close
      to my house and work site and the educators were very friendly and
      welcoming.


      My eldest girls is 6 years old now and she attended the Daycare when she
      was around 6months old. I have since had 2 more children and they both
      attend there. They have formed bonds with the Educators, which makes me
      feel happy knowing my children feel safe with the educators and I don’t
      have to worry too much about them. I love seeing how all my children show
      that connection with the Educators, and they are excited to attend. Even
      when they are sad and sometimes don’t want to be there first thing, but
      the educators makes it so easy by making sure the kids are ok and will
      have an enjoyable day, also by comforting them when they are upset.


      Also the Centre is very cosy and feels like home when you take the
      children there. They have lots of activities ready for them to do and the
      food is great. Knowing your children are going to have a healthy nutrition
      for the day and seeing them just settle right in when you drop them off.
      Also I love how it’s multi cultured and the Centre is very great in
      wanting to be part of stories, activities when it comes to NAIDOC day, The
      Educators always ask what my thoughts and ideas are to improve their
      NAIDOC Celebrations which makes me feel happy and recognized as a parent
      and knowing the Centre really wants to learn about our culture and
      memories.


      Also seeing all the friendships my children share with other kids-all the
      children make you feel welcome as well as their parents. Always friendly
      and can stop and have a chat with the parents it’s like the center is my
      children’s second home where they feel happy and safe.


      I have recommended the Centre to a few families I know and I have stopped
      and had a chat with them. They always have good comments about the Centre
      and Educators and are happy that I recommended it for them.


      Thank you’ s for taking care of my children and making them feel happy and
      safe

      All three of my children have attended Mildura Central Early Learning
      Centre. As a parent, child care is always a daunting thought and process
      to begin. The educators at MCELC have made the process for each of my
      children, and myself very positive with their positive and respectful
      nature. 


      As a parent, it is very comforting knowing that my children are in the
      care of such loving, kind educators who are passionate about their job and
      the wellbeing and happiness of the children. The interaction from the
      educators is fantastic and professional. Parents are regularly updated
      with programs, excursions and celebrations that the children are always
      involved in. 


      The day my last child leaves Mildura Central Early Learning Centre will be
      a sad day, as they and myself have formed some wonderful connections with
      the educators. I am more than satisfied with the care my children receive
      here, and I would definitely recommend the centre to anyone that is
      searching for a child care centre for their children.

      As parents, we entrust our greatest blessings to the wonderful educators
      at Mildura Central Early Learning Centre two days each week, and we are
      forever grateful for the loving care and attention they both receive. The
      educators and director look at each child as an individual, with their own
      strengths and needs. Both of our children have and continue to learn
      something new each day they attend the centre and we are kept up to date
      with their development in line with their individual learning goals via an
      app. We love reading about what they have experienced in the centre each
      day, and enjoy looking at the photos of their day which makes leaving them
      in the care of someone else that little bit easier. We have always found
      the director to be flexible with unexpected changes to our routines and
      love that we are welcomed at every pick up and drop off with a smile. We
      have absolutely no hesitation recommending Mildura Central Early Learning
      Centre!
